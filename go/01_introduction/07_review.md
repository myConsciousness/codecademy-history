Great job! You’ve just finished your first Go lesson! In this lesson you learned about:

- What Go/Golang is.
- What Go is used for.
- Go’s compiler.
- How to compile Go files into an executable.
- Running an executable file.
- Running a Go file without outright compiling it.
- What a Go package is.
- How to import a Go package.
- How to import multiple Go packages.
- The uniqueness of the main function in a main package.
- How to find help and information.

This first step into a new and fantastical language is the start of a wonderful journey. It’s up to you to decide how far to Go.
